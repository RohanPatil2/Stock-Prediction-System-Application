# Stock Market Prediction & Sentiment Analysis System

![Stock Market Prediction Banner](./app/static/image/banner.png)

## Overview

This web application not only predicts stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques but also incorporates real-time Twitter sentiment analysis powered by a custom BERT model. By integrating dynamic data visualization and interactive elements, the platform delivers actionable insights for traders and investors. Additionally, the solution integrates functionalities from the [Stock Price AI Bot](https://github.com/RohanPatil2/Stock-Price-AI-Bot.git), thereby providing an end-to-end system for both prediction and sentiment evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Stock Prediction:**  
  Leverages a Multiple Linear Regression model for forecasting future stock prices based on real-time data from Yahoo Finance API.

- **Dynamic Data Visualization:**  
  Interactive graphs display historical and predicted stock trends with live updates.

- **Twitter Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Utilizes a custom BERT model to analyze Twitter data related to specific stock tickers, enabling users to gauge market sentiment.

- **Integrated AI Bot:**  
  Combines functionalities from the [Stock Price AI Bot](https://github.com/RohanPatil2/Stock-Price-AI-Bot.git) for enhanced trading insights.

- **QR Code Generation:**  
  Provides unique QR codes linking to detailed prediction results for easy sharing and access.

- **Responsive and Dynamic Interface:**  
  Developed using Django with modern front-end frameworks to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

## Project Architecture

1. **Backend:**  
   - Django for web framework.
